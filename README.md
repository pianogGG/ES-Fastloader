# Introduction
# <img src="imgs/logo.png" width="250px" align="center" alt="ES-Fastloader"/>
The ES-Fastloader uses the fault tolerance and parallelism of Hadoop and builds individual ElasticSearch shards in multiple reducer nodes, then transfers shards to ElasticSearch cluster for serving. The loader will create a Hadoop job to read data from data files in HDFS, repartitions it on a per-node basis, and finally writes the generated indices to ES shards. In DiDi we have been using ES-Fastloader to create large-scale ElasticSearch indices from TB/PB level sequence files in Hive. 

# Features
* Supports batch construction of ES indexes, which can quickly process dozens of terabytes of data in 1-2 hours, and solve the low-efficiency problem when building massive ES index files.
* Support the horizontal expansion of computing power, and facilitate the expansion. By increasing the machine resources, you can further increase the index construction speed and the amount of data processed.

# Requirements
* JDK: 8 or greater
* ElasticSearch: 6.6.X or greater
